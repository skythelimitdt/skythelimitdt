# Eylem Yildirim
**`Marketing Manager / Data Scientist / Gym Rat / Mother`**

I’m a marketing professional with a passion for turning numbers into narratives and optimizing everything—whether it's ad performance, machine learning models, or even my kids’ Uno strategy. With over 15 years in e-commerce, performance marketing, and ad-tech, I thrive on uncovering insights that drive real business impact. I specialize in SQL, Python, big data, and machine learning, helping businesses maximize ROI, improve KPIs, and optimize LTV.

When I’m not diving into datasets or fine-tuning predictive models, you’ll find me staying active—whether it’s working out, sprinting around the park in epic races with my kids, or outthinking them in a heated Uno showdown (spoiler: they win more than I’d like to admit). I also love reading and constantly exploring ways to refine strategies, not just in business but in life. My goal? To keep pushing boundaries, solving complex problems, and making data-driven decisions that matter.

## 💡 My Approach to Work and Life
I don't just analyze data; I apply lessons learned from both experience and wisdom to create impactful, thoughtful results. Here's how I live by The Four Agreements:  <br>
**`→ 1. Be Impeccable with Your Word`**  
I lead with clarity and transparency, whether it’s crafting SQL queries, explaining machine learning models, or simply communicating with teammates. My words are tools for inspiring trust and delivering value!    
**`→ 2. Don’t Take Anything Personally`**  
In data, there’s no room for ego. Whether I’m troubleshooting a model’s performance or handling constructive feedback, I stay objective and focused. The data speaks for itself, and I listen to it with an open mind.    
**`→ 3. Don’t Make Assumptions`**  
I know the power of asking the right questions. Rather than assume, I dig deep into data, ask stakeholders for clarity, and ensure that I understand all the facts before jumping to conclusions. That’s how I uncover the true story behind the numbers.     
**`→ 4. Always Do Your Best`**  
Whether it’s optimizing a machine learning model or refining a marketing campaign, I give my all. I strive for continuous improvement, learning from each experience to become better at what I do and deliver results that matter.
